Hola Akshar,

How are you? I am fine. I wish the same for you. I have been trekking in the Himalayas and writing this letter to  tell you about it. My recent trek to Himalaya was the best trip of my life. Despite many difficulties and mishaps we were lucky to have received good help from friends who helped us reach the summit.


I really enjoyed it and had a great time there. It was worth leaving all the hassle of city life behind. The trail passes through high altitude mountain landscapes. The whole trek took me one hundred and fifty days. We visited some of the most remote villages on earth where life remains as it was centuries back. Vast gorges and rivers , deep valleys, and breathtaking  glaciers are what you will see in Annapurna circuit. It not only bonded me to nature but also made me realise the importance of human relations.


There are many places on earth that I would love to visit again. I hope this mail inspires you to try something new.

I posted the pictures of my trek on social media. Next time you are in the mountain area , we should get together and go trekking again.


My prayers will always be with you,stay safe and happy!<br>

Your loving friend,<br>
Deepak
